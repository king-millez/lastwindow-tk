# Last Window ROM Toolkit

Scripts to work with the files inside the ROM for Last Window: The Secret of Cape West.

## Supported Files

- Pack (.pack) - these are custom `zlib` archives that can be extracted to a folder using `python3 unpack.py <input.pack> <output dir>`

## Todo

- All the others, mainly:
    - .bra - animation files
    - .bpg - image format (this one doesn't seem custom, but the only public format out there is from 2014 - 4 years after the game came out. Yes I have tried that format anyway and it does not work; surprise)
